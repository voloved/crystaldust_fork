# Pokémon CrystalDust

This is a ROM hack of Pokémon Emerald that aims to recreate Pokémon Crystal on the GBA, as if Game Freak had remade it themselves at that time.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

This project is based on [**pokeemerald**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald), a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.
