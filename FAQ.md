## Hack Development and Progress:
### I thought CrystalDust was cancelled! What happened? Has development resumed?
In June of 2021, Sierraffinity (the original creator of CrystalDust) announced that she was moving on from CrystalDust and would not be continuing its development. In this announcement, she indicated that she would be willing to pass on the project to someone else who was interested in and capable of finishing it.

On the same day, Deokishisu inquired about picking up CrystalDust and, after some discussion, Sierraffinity agreed. Deokishisu resumed development almost immediately after the project was cancelled.

Currently, CrystalDust's primary developer is Deokishisu, and development is ongoing. Sierraffinity is still involved in a more advisory capacity, and occasionally contributes code and features that she is interested in doing.

### How far does the most recent version of CrystalDust go?
The latest publicly-available release is the v3 public alpha released by Sierraffinity in December of 2020. This release goes up to Sudowoodo. This release, and all previous releases, are available at [DoMoreAweso.me](https://domoreaweso.me/games/pokemon-crystaldust)

Deokishisu's unreleased development branch (frequently referred to as the "progress branch") includes nearly all content up to and including Red on Mt. Silver and is entirely playable, albeit it is missing some music and features. No official release of this branch is available, so playtesters interested in trying it out will have to build it themselves. [This is the link to the progress branch.](https://github.com/Deokishisu/CrystalDust/tree/progress) Please note, the progress branch is incompatible with saves from earlier CrystalDust releases and saves from the progress branch will likely be incompatible with the next official release.

### When will a new version of CrystalDust be released? What will it include?
Development of CrystalDust is primarily the work of one person who is doing this as a hobby for free in his spare time. Due to this, there is no clear timeframe for when a new version of CrystalDust will be officially released. There will likely be an announcement that a release is imminent as it reaches completion.

The next release should include *at the very least* everything present in the original Crystal Version (that is, content up to and including the Red battle on Mt. Silver), in addition to the Hoenn Battle Frontier.

### Is there a way to contribute to CrystalDust's development?
We are currently in need of Generation III-style remixes of Crystal music. If you can help with this, please inquire in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jHZ5HshEAA).

If you opted to build and play the progress branch, you can contribute by reporting bugs in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jHZ5HshEAA).

While donations do not directly help with or fund CrystalDust's development, [the developers appreciate them regardless](#how-can-i-support-the-developers).

### Are there plans to include more content than there was in the original Crystal Version? If so, what are they?
Yes. Currently, the Sevii Islands are planned as content available when Mt. Silver is unlocked. Nothing of the Sevii Islands is currently implemented, and plans for this area are not available publicly at this time. Please do not ask about the specifics of the Sevii Islands, as development is presently focused on finishing the original Crystal Version's content and Battle Frontier.

With the exception of the Sevii Islands, there are no other plans for additional content at this time.

### Are there plans to add the whole Hoenn region?
No. The only Hoenn locations accessible will be the Battle Frontier and potentially Southern Island.

### Will features/changes from HeartGold and SoulSilver be added?
In general, no. CrystalDust is meant to mirror what Game Freak themselves may have done if they had released a Crystal remake at the end of Generation III. Features like following Pokémon, the Pokéathlon, specific changes to maps and plot points, etc. will not be included.

### Will there be a release with more modern mechanics?
Sierraffinity considered making a modern fork of the game that would include updated mechanics, quality of life features, and later generation Pokémon, but she is no longer heavily involved in development.

Currently, Deokishisu has no plans to make a modern fork and is focused on finishing CrystalDust in its entirety before considering further modifications and "spin-off" releases.


## Mechanics:
#### *In general, mechanics are left identical to Generation III.*
### Will later-generation battle mechanics be implemented? What about the physical/special split?
No. This hack aims to preserve the original battle mechanics and maintain link compatibility with the official games. Changing the battle mechanics runs contrary to those goals.

### Will new moves be implemented? New held items?
No. This hack aims to preserve the original battle mechanics and maintain link compatibility with the official games. Adding new moves or held items runs contrary to those goals.

### Will the Generation VI+ Experience Share be implemented?
No.

### Will you improve breeding mechanics?
Emerald's improved breeding mechanics are implemented, but no further improvements will be made. This hack is not meant to supplant the official games when it comes to obtaining good Pokémon.

### What are the shiny chances? Will they be improved?
The shiny chance is 1/8192, as it was in Generation III. The odds of encountering a shiny Pokémon will not be increased. The Red Gyarados in Lake of Rage is still guaranteed to be shiny.

### Will you add something to change my Pokémon's IVs/Hidden Power/Nature/etc.?
No. This hack is not meant to supplant the official games when it comes to obtaining good Pokémon.

### Will text be decapitalized?
No.

## Pokémon Availability:

### Will you add later-generation Pokémon?
No, Pokémon introduced after Generation III will not be included.

### How many Pokémon are available? Will *all* Pokémon be obtainable?
All Pokémon that were available in the original Crystal Version will be available. Though the Sevii Islands are postgame locations that are not yet implemented, Hoenn Pokémon and the Pokémon missing from Crystal will be available there. This hack does not add any new Pokémon that were not available in Generation III. You will still need to trade to obtain the other starters and trade evolutions.

### Can I obtain the version-exclusive Pokémon that were missing from the original Crystal Version?
Though the Sevii Islands are postgame locations that are not yet implemented, the version-exclusive Pokémon that were missing from the original Crystal Version will be available there. Otherwise, you will have to trade with the official games to obtain them.

### Can you change wild Pokémon availability/levels? Can you put *x* Pokémon in *y* map? Will you add in Pokémon missing from Crystal to the grass (i.e. Mareep)?
Pokémon follow the original Crystal Version's availability. Though the Sevii Islands are postgame locations that are not yet implemented, version exclusives missing from the original Crystal will be available there. Otherwise, you will have to trade with the official games to obtain them.

### Is there a list of wild encounter tables?
As of now, CrystalDust follows the original Crystal Version's encounter tables. Refer to Bulbapedia or your favorite alternative to look up where certain Pokémon were available in the original Crystal.

### Can I obtain the other Johto starters?
No. You will have to trade to obtain the other Johto starters.

### Can I evolve trade evolutions without trading?
No. You will have to trade to evolve Pokémon that evolve by trading.

### When is the earliest that I can trade? What are the link restrictions?
Initially, CrystalDust can only trade with other CrystalDust games. When the player first reaches the Ecruteak City Pokémon Center, they will trigger the Time Capsule to be built at midnight. Once the Time Capsule is built, trading with Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, LeafGreen, Colosseum, and XD: Gale of Darkness is possible. At this time, connecting with Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire is also possible.

Certain event distribution carts that were compatible with the original Emerald Version can also be used with CrystalDust, and the only restriction on receiving those distributions is that the player has at least one Pokémon.

Battles between CrystalDust and the official games have no restrictions.

## Gameplay:

### I have a gameplay question that also applies to the original Crystal Version!
Outside of battle and Pokémon mechanics, CrystalDust attempts to mirror the original Crystal Version as closely as possible. If you have a question about where to go next, where to find a certain Pokémon in Johto or Kanto, or a question about plot events, you can refer to discussions and FAQs available online regarding the original Crystal Version to answer them.

### Will [feature or thing that was in the original Crystal Version] be included in CrystalDust?
Unless otherwise noted, yes, most everything that the original Crystal Version included will be included in CrystalDust. Some exceptions have been made in some areas (the Crystal Battle Tower, mentions of the Gameboy Printer, use of Crystal's original IR Mystery Gift functionality, etc.) to better reflect how Game Freak may have handled things had they released a Crystal remake at the end of Generation III.

### Is the original Crystal Version's Battle Tower included?
No. It has been replaced with a dock that leads to the Hoenn Battle Frontier.

### How does the original Crystal Version's IR Mystery Gift and Viridian Trainer House functionality work in CrystalDust?
Though this is not yet implemented, Crystal's IR Mystery Gift will be replaced by linking with Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, and other CrystalDust games to mix records. Mystery Gift items (including room decorations) will be available from the delivery man on the second floor of all Pokémon Centers. Trainer rosters transferred through Record Mixing will be placed in the Viridian Trainer House's basement.

### Is the Battle Frontier included? How do I get there?
Yes, the Hoenn Battle Frontier seen in Emerald Version is included. The player will be invited to visit the Battle Frontier before leaving the S.S. Aqua for the first time. Afterwards, the Battle Frontier is accessible from the dock on Route 40 which replaces the original Crystal Version's Battle Tower.

**Warning**: The Battle Frontier and its dock on Route 40 are currently unfinished and very buggy. It is possible to get permanently trapped in the Battle Frontier. If this occurs, you will need to start a new game. Exploring the Battle Frontier is done at your own risk. The developers will not fix saves that were softlocked in the Battle Frontier before it is officially released.

### I can run indoors! Is this a bug?
No. The ability to run indoors is an intentional quality-of-life feature.

### Why are the TM moves different?
To maintain link compatibility, CrystalDust's TMs are identical to the Generation III TMs. Most moves that were originally available as TMs in Generation II can now be taught through new move tutors scattered around Kanto and Johto.

### Where are the new Move Tutors and what moves do they teach?
<details>
    <summary>New move tutor locations:</summary>

• Nightmare - Route 31

• Mud-Slap - Violet City
    
• Fury Cutter - Azalea Town

• Headbutt - Ilex Forest

• Endure - Goldenrod City

• Dream Eater - Viridian City

The Sleep Talk tutor in Goldenrod City is not available until Team Rocket is defeated in the Radio Tower.
</details>

## Troubleshooting Savefiles, Emulators, and Flashcarts:

### Is my save from a previous version of CrystalDust compatible with the progress branch?
No, and there is currently no way to make saves from previous versions compatible.

### Will my save from the progress branch be compatible with the next release or a different build of the progress branch?
Possibly not, and very likely not for the next official release. The progress branch is an in-development build and even saves from one development build to the next may not be compatible. To ease development, there are no guarantees that saves from the progress branch will be compatible with the official release, nor that they will be compatible for every prerelease build going forward. You play the progress branch at your own risk.

### My emulator/flashcart doesn't work with CrystalDust! The game won't save or the clock won't function!
The recommended emulator for desktop is [mGBA](https://mgba.io/downloads.html).

If your emulator or flashcart isn't working properly with CrystalDust, follow instructions for that particular emulator or flashcart for playing the original Emerald Version and apply them to getting CrystalDust to work. The clock will not function if your emulator or flashcart does not support an RTC.
